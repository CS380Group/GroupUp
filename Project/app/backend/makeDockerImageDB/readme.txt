First, make sure you have docker installed. If not, go to https://www.docker.com/get-started and install.
Second, build the dockerfile or, optionally, use the pre-written build script.
Third, run the newly created docker container with port 3306:3306 or, optionally, run the pre-written run script.
If all goes well, the database should be running at port 3306 which the code is already setup to use.
